Live or Live

Objective
This is a game of strategy and survival. Your goal is to be the last player standing by shooting other players (or yourself) while carefully managing your items.

Getting Started
    Players: You need at least 2 players to start, but more can join—there’s no upper limit!
    Lives: Each player begins with 5 lives.
    Turn Order: The game assigns a turn order at the start and keeps it consistent throughout the game.

How to Play
    Rounds & Chamber Setup:
        The game is divided into rounds. At the beginning of each round, the chamber is loaded with 1-6 blank shells and 1-6 live shells. The shells are then shuffled.

    Your Turn:
        On your turn, you must shoot another player or yourself. You can also use items before you shoot.
        Shoot Yourself: If you shoot yourself, you get to go again.
        Shoot Another Player: If you shoot another player with a live round, or any player with a blank round, your turn ends immediately.
        No Passing: You must shoot on your turn, but you can use items first to increase your chances of survival.

    Items:
        +1 Life: Automatically gives you an extra life when received.
        Skip: Skip another player’s turn. You can also skip your own turn, but a player can only have one skip applied at a time.
        Double Damage: If your next shot is a live round, it deals 2 lives of damage. If it's blank, the item is wasted.
        Chamber Check: Reveals if the next round in the chamber is live or blank.
        Rebalancer: Adds 1-6 rounds of your chosen type (live or blank) to the chamber and reshuffles it. The chamber can’t exceed 20 rounds.
        Adrenaline: 50% chance to gain a life or lose one.
        Pickpocket: Steal an item from another player (except another Pickpocket). The stolen item is used immediately.
        Quickshot: If your shot would normally end your turn, it doesn’t. Shoot again!

    Elimination:
        You’re eliminated when you lose all your lives. Keep an eye on your life count—one wrong move, and it’s game over!

    Winning the Game:
        The last player standing wins. If you outlast everyone else, you’re the victor!

Special Rules
    Rounds without Time Limits: Rounds go on until the chamber is empty. If players keep reshuffling the chamber (e.g., using Rebalancer), new items are dealt after 4 turn loops without clearing the chamber.
    Looting (Optional): If enabled, you can loot the items of a player you eliminate. However, if you kill yourself, your items are lost.
    Vengeance (Optional): If enabled, the skip status of a player you kill transfers to you. Skipping yourself can be a useful insurance policy!
